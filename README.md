# Hashslinger

ruby to shellscript DSL project inspired by not wanting to learn Chef nor Puppet, nor use bash directly

    gem 'hashslinger'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hashslinger

## Usage

Call it from your Vagrantfile.
Oh, you can't. I'll need to turn it into a vagrant plugin.
